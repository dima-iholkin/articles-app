1. Create a certificate directly into the Windows Certificate Store.

PowerShell 7 (latest):
> New-SelfSignedCertificate -certstorelocation cert:\currentuser\my -KeyAlgorithm RSA -KeyLength 2048 -DnsName articlesapp.com

Check the certificate in the Windows Certificate Store:
> Run (Win + R) -> certmgr.msc -> (Certificates - CurrentUser) -> Personal -> Certificates -> articlesapp.com

> https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/pki/new-selfsignedcertificate?view=windowsserver2019-ps



2. Configure the IdentityServer to use this cert in appsettings.json.

appsettings.json:
> "IdentityServer": {
    "Key": {
      "Type": "Store",
      "StoreName": "My",
      "StoreLocation": "CurrentUser",
      "Name": "CN=articlesapp.com"
    }
  },

3. Check out the current certs at the IdentityServer endpoint.
> https://localhost:5001/.well-known/openid-configuration/jwks

> https://docs.identityserver.io/en/latest/endpoints/discovery.html



4. Possible errors:
> If the process somehow doesn't have access to the private key. Happened to me when I saved the cert to the "localmachine", not the "CurrentUser" - probably it had required more priviledges.



5. To rotate the certificates - some more actions are needed.
> It's recommended to rotate the keys at least every 90 days.
